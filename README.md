# Boostraping my Debian 7 Wheezy

This is an opinionated script that boostraps my Debian 7 wheezy
installation.

Some configurations are borrowed from @agorf

Nothing fancy here

## Packages

It installs and configures (according to my taste) the following
packages

* vim (Janus)
* i3
* Ruby (1.9.3-p327 with falcon patch)
* Rails (3.2.13)
* htop
* gcc
* build-essential
* rxvt-unicode-256color
* git

Feel free to fork!
